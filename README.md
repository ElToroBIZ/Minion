# Minion
Metasploit automation. Why work when a minion can do it? The minion plugin looks at imported Nessus or NMAP data in the MSF database, then automates running MSF modules against services that were identified.

1) Place the minion.rb in the Metasploit Plugin directory (typically ~/.msf4/plugins).
2) Open msfconsole, and type "load minion"
3) Type "help" to display a list of "Minion Commands"
